This application is a simple webpage with three buttons. The POST button creates a list of movies.
The GET button displays the list of movies. The PUT button adds a movie to said list and the DELETE button deletes the list. 
Just run the webpage with flask (flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=16930), go to localhost (http://0.0.0.0:16930/), and select one of the three buttons.
